Two main files:
 * retrieve.py, which downloads all the xkcd images (now stored in raw)
 * stitch.py tilesize images...
 	* Must provide a tilesize (128, 256, 512, 768, 1024, 2048 all included). Each tile will be resized to this small and placed 
 	* Must provide a list of images as the remaining arguments. 
 	* Typically used like "python stitch.py 128 raw/*.png"

* Requires Python Imaging Library, a relatively recent python, and a shitload of RAM if you want a large tile size. 

1024x1024 tile and 2048x2048 tile (full size) composites generated on an EC2 high mem (m2.xlarge) instance this is due to memory requires - it required ~13GB of RAM. Just opening 1024x1024 in Preview.ap pegged the CPU for a while, and requires ~1GB of RAM.
